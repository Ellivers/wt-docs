## Undo and Redo

The first features of this menu are the <MCFont color="#036ffc">[↩Undo]</MCFont> and <MCFont color="#7c2bff">[Redo↪]</MCFont> buttons.

Pretty self-explanatorily, these undo or redo the changes you've made using WorldTool's tools.

:::info backups
The backups that are used for the <MCFont color="#036ffc">[↩Undo]</MCFont> and <MCFont color="#7c2bff">[Redo↪]</MCFont> functionality **will be lost** if the data pack is reloaded by either using the `/reload` command or restarting the world.

## Preview Shape

The <MCFont color="#9729ff">[Preview Shape]</MCFont> option toggles whether to show particles to help with generating the shape, and many more things. These particles are **only visible to you**.

## Settings

Main page: [Settings](../settings/main).

## Kill Process

The <MCFont color="red">[Kill Process]</MCFont> button kills the currently running process, if there is one. Main page: [Processes](../technical/processes).
