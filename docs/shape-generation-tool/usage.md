The way it looks in the image above is the default state of the menu.
#
To **set a position**, right-click with the tool on a block.
#
By default, the [Cylinder](cylinder) shape is selected. To change the selected shape, use the Â­<MCFont color="green">[Change...]</MCFont> button at the top of the menu.

:::tip
All set shape options and shapes are specific to that Shape Generation Tool item. This means you can make multiple tool items with the shape options and shapes you need. You can give yourself more shape generation tools with `/loot give @s loot worldtool:shape_tool`, or you can use the **middle mouse button** on shape generation tools in the inventory to make copies of them (while in creative mode).

## Shape Options
What shape options are available depends on the selected shape.
