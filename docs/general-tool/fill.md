# Fill

Filling is the primary operation for the General Tool. It's the first thing in the menu you see when clicking the <MCFont color="green">[Use...]</MCFont> button.<br></br>

Pretty simple, really. It's just a [block selection menu](../chat-menu-system#block-selection). Once you've selected a block, the area will be filled with your chosen block.
