The <MCFont color="aqua">[▶Size]</MCFont> operation gets the total volume of the area, as well as the area dimensions (length, width, and height) of it.<br></br>
The <MCFont color="light_purple">[▶Distance]</MCFont> operation gets the distance between the two set corner positions. The resulting value is floored.<br></br>
The <MCFont color="green">[▶Get Positions]</MCFont> operation simply gets the two selected positions.<br></br>
The <MCFont color="gold">[Filter...]</MCFont> button opens a menu that lets you either search for a certain block (<MCFont color="green">[Normal]</MCFont>), or search for all blocks *except* a certain block (<MCFont color="gold">[Exclude]</MCFont>). It gives you the amount of blocks found, as well as what area dimensions those blocks make up.
