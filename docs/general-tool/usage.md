#

:::tip
This menu is opened whenever the General Tool is right-clicked. You can **aim into the sky** to open this menu without having to set a position. Alternatively, you can **sneak and drop the tool** while on the ground to open it.
:::

[Click](../chat-menu-system) the <MCFont color="green">[Use...]</MCFont> button to open the General Tool's main menu.

## Main menu
![The main General Tool menu](img/main_menu.png)

Here in the **main menu** is where you can find all the different **operations** the General Tool can perform.

At the bottom you can flip through 2 pages to find what you're looking for, with the second page containing more specific and niche operations.
#
The <MCFont color="#0aad02">[Keep]</MCFont> option at the top of the menu lets you toggle whether to replace existing blocks. This option generally works with every operation, but there are some exceptions.
