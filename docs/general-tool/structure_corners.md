# Structure Corners

The Structure Corners menu can be found with the <MCFont color="#3a2ffa">[Structure Corners...]</MCFont> button in the [main General Tool menu](usage#main-menu). This operation places two structure blocks in corner mode outside the corners of the selected area, that can be used to quickly save an area as a structure.
