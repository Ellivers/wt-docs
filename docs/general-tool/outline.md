# Outline
![[Example of what this operation can look like]](img/operation_previews/outline.png)

The Outline menu can be found with the <MCFont color="#4929ff">[Outline...]</MCFont> button in the [main General Tool menu](usage#main-menu). This operation makes an outline of the selected block, right inside the selection.

The [block selection menu](../chat-menu-system#block-selection) at the bottom of the menu starts the Outline operation once you select a block with it.

## Outline Size
The <MCFont>Outline size</MCFont> option lets you set how many blocks thick the outline is.
