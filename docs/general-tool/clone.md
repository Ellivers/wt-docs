# Clone

The Clone menu can be found with the <MCFont color="dark_blue">[Clone...]</MCFont> button in the [main General Tool menu](usage#main-menu). This operation allows you to copy or move an area from one place to another.
#

First of all, the <MCFont color="light_purple">[Destination]</MCFont> option lets you toggle between placing the cloned area at a right-clicked block in the world (<MCFont color="light_purple">At Block</MCFont>) and placing the cloned area at your player position (<MCFont color="light_purple">At Player</MCFont>).

## Modes
The <MCFont>Mode</MCFont> option allows you to choose between two different cloning modes.
#
<MCFont color="green">Standard</MCFont>, the default mode, includes all rotation and filter functionality, but does not rotate individual blocks properly. For example, stairs facing one way still face the same way after being rotated.<br></br>
The <MCFont color="green">Template</MCFont> mode is faster, and rotates individual blocks properly, unlike the other mode. However, the area can only be rotated around the Y axis and mirrored on one the X or Z axes, and the filter functionality is not supported.

## Filter
The <MCFont color="gold">[Filter]</MCFont> option lets you enable a filter to either only clone a certain block (<MCFont color="green">[Normal]</MCFont>), or clone all blocks except a certain block (<MCFont color="gold">[Exclude]</MCFont>). Once enabled, the filter can be disabled by clicking the button again.

## Rotating
This rotation menu can be opened through the <MCFont color="#9122d6">[Rotate...]</MCFont> button.<br></br>

This is what the menu looks like with the full rotation availability of the <MCFont color="green">Standard</MCFont> [cloning mode](#modes).
#
In this rotation menu, you can change the rotation in 90Â° steps and toggle mirroring on the different axes.

Once the menu has been opened, this **rotation helper** shows up in front of you:<br></br>
![The rotation helper observer buddy](img/clone_rotation_helper.png)

This serious-looking little buddy helps you by turning its head according to the rotation and mirror axes you select. The red dot shows the **starting position**, which is where the rotation helper faces when there's no rotation active.
#
To reset all rotation, you can use the <MCFont color="#5a20e3">[Reset]</MCFont> button at the bottom of the menu.
