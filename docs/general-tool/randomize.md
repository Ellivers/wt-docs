# Randomize
![[Example of what this operation can look like]](img/operation_previews/randomize.png)

The Randomize menu can be found with the <MCFont color="dark_aqua">[Randomize...]</MCFont> button in the [main General Tool menu](usage#main-menu). This operation allows you to place blocks randomly from a source area.

## Select Source
If you have not selected a source for getting random blocks yet, the <MCFont color="yellow">[â–¶Run]</MCFont> button will be **grayed out**. The <MCFont color="light_purple">[Select Source...]</MCFont> button opens a menu that allows you to select two corner positions of the area you'd like to have blocks taken from and used in the Randomize operation.
#
![[The first page of the source selection menu]](img/randomize_source_position_1_menu.png)

You can select a corner of the source area by either right-clicking a block with the General Tool to place it there, or using the <MCFont color="yellow">[Set Position Here]</MCFont> button to place it at your player position.
#
After both positions have been set, you have to option to either select <MCFont color="light_purple">[Exclude...]</MCFont> and then choose which blocks to ignore from the source region, or select <MCFont color="green">[Continue with All Blocks...]</MCFont> to continue normally.

## Replace
The <MCFont color="gold">[Replace]</MCFont> option lets you choose to either replace a certain block (<MCFont color="green">[Normal]</MCFont>), or replace all blocks except a certain block (<MCFont color="gold">[Exclude]</MCFont>). Once enabled, replacing can be disabled by clicking the button again.
