# Greenery
The Greenery brush is a copy of the General Tool's [Greenery operation](../general-tool/greenery), without the 足<MCFont color="gold">[Replace]</MCFont> feature.
#
By default, the Plains plant source is selected. To change it, use the 足<MCFont color="aqua">[Select Plant Source...]</MCFont> button in the main Brush Tool menu.

## Options
* 足<MCFont color="light_purple">[Remove Current Greenery]</MCFont> - `On` or `Off`. If enabled, all greenery in the area is removed before new greenery is placed.
* 足<MCFont color="green">Plant rate</MCFont> - A number from 0 to 100. The percentage chance for each block to have greenery placed on it.
