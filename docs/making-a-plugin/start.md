# Start

Guides and information on various parts of making a plugin for WorldTool. A plugin is another data pack that can be added to the same world as WorldTool and has the ability to add and change various stuff.

## Example

An example plugin can be found [here](http://fake_link_lolol). This plugin adds a General Tool operation and Brush Tool brush that places snow on top of blocks.

## Getting Started

To get started, first create a new data pack. Do not use the "worldtool" namespace, use your own.
